What were some challenges you faced while making this app?
Routing, using context providers, and just understanding the flow of using React and how to use components together

Given more time, what additional features, functional or design changes would you make
I'd probably make it more robust and make use of UseEffect so that I can type with my keyboard instead of just clicking buttons. Perhaps
add more words to my "dictionary"

What assumptions did you make while working on this assignment?
I assumed that the app can take any string since I only have a limited number of real words stored in the app

How long did this assignment take to complete?
20-30 hours and I did not work with anyone
